# MERN inventory

This is the start of an app to take an inventory and create a shopping list.

It's using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

The first user story I'm working on is:
Create an ingredient, assigning it a place that it lives (e.g. in the cupboard, in the fridge etc.).
